A **Threat Vector** is the specific path or method an attacker uses to gain access to a target. To secure a network, you must understand all possible entry points—collectively known as the **Attack Surface**.

## 1. Communication & Messaging Vectors

These vectors exploit human trust and common communication channels.

* **Message-Based Vectors:**
* **Phishing/Email:** The most common vector. Malicious links or attachments sent via email.
* **Smishing (SMS Phishing):** Attacks via text messages, often using urgent language about bank accounts or deliveries.
* **SPIM:** Spam over Instant Messaging (e.g., WhatsApp, Slack).


* **Voice Call Vectors (Vishing):** * Attackers use "Voice Phishing" to impersonate authority figures (IT support, IRS, Bank) to trick users into revealing credentials or MFA codes.
* **Image-Based Vectors:**
* Attackers hide malicious code inside image files (Steganography) or embed links in high-resolution images that execute code when rendered by a vulnerable browser.

## 2. File and Device Vectors

These rely on the delivery of malicious payloads through physical or digital files.

* **File-Based Vectors:** * Malicious PDFs, Office documents with **Macros**, or `.exe` installers. Attackers often "zip" files to bypass simple antivirus scanners.
* **Removable Device Vectors:** * USB drives, external hard drives, or even charging cables.
* **The "Road Apple" Attack:** Leaving a malicious USB in a parking lot, hoping an employee plugs it into a work computer out of curiosity.

## 3. System and Software Vulnerability Vectors

These exploit weaknesses in the technical environment itself.

* **Vulnerable Software:** * Applications with known bugs (CVEs) that haven't been patched.
* **Unsupported / Legacy Systems:** * Systems like Windows 7 or old Linux kernels that no longer receive security updates. These are "sitting ducks" for attackers.
* **Unsecured Systems:** * Systems that are working but misconfigured—for example, a server with **encryption disabled** or missing a firewall.

---

## 4. Configuration & Access Vectors

The "low-hanging fruit" for attackers.

* **Open Service Ports:** * Leaving ports open that aren't needed (e.g., Telnet on port 23 or RDP on port 3389). Every open port is a door; if it doesn't need to be open, it should be closed.
* **Default Credentials:** * Using the factory-set username/password (e.g., `admin/admin` or `guest/1234`). Attackers have databases of these and try them automatically.

---

## 5. Supply Chain Vectors

This is a high-priority topic for the SY0-701. It involves attacking a target by compromising a third-party vendor or tool they trust.

* **Software Supply Chain:** An attacker compromises a software update (like the **SolarWinds** attack). When the victims update their software, they unknowingly install the attacker's back door.
* **Hardware Supply Chain:** Malicious chips or firmware are installed in devices during the manufacturing or shipping process.
* **Service Providers:** Attacking a Managed Service Provider (MSP) to gain access to all of the MSP's clients simultaneously.
