## 1. Attributes and Motivations

When analyzing a threat actor, we look at three specific "scales" of measurement:

* **Sophistication:** How advanced are their tools? Do they use basic scripts or "Zero-Day" exploits?
* **Resources/Funding:** Do they have a basement budget, or are they backed by a government with billions of dollars?
* **Intent/Motivation:** Are they trying to steal money, make a political point, or start a war?

| Actor Type | Sophistication | Funding | Motivation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Nation-State** | Very High | Massive | Geopolitics, Espionage, Power. |
| **Organized Crime** | High | High | **Financial Gain** (Money). |
| **Hacktivist** | Medium | Limited | Social/Political Change. |
| **Insider Threat** | Varies | Internal Access | Revenge, Greed, Accidental. |
| **Unskilled** | Low | Low | Fame, Learning, Chaos. |

## 2. Nation-States (APTs)

These are the "Heavy Hitters." Often referred to as **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**.

* **Goal:** Strategic advantage, intellectual property theft (Corporate Espionage), or disrupting a country’s infrastructure (Power grids, elections).
* **Attributes:** They have the time and money to stay hidden in a network for years. They don't just "smash and grab"; they exfiltrate data slowly to avoid detection.

---

## 3. Unskilled Attackers (Script Kiddies)

These actors lack technical depth. They use pre-written tools or "scripts" found on GitHub or the Dark Web.

* **Goal:** To prove they can do it, gain social status, or cause simple disruption.
* **Attribute:** They are often caught easily because their attacks are noisy and unrefined.

---

## 4. Hacktivists

A blend of "Hacker" and "Activist." They attack targets that contradict their ideology.

* **Goal:** To embarrass an organization, leak sensitive data (doxing), or deface websites.
* **Attribute:** They often use **DDoS** (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks to shut down a site and gain media attention.

---

## 5. Insider Threats

This is anyone with **authorized access** who uses that access to cause harm.

* **Disgruntled Employee:** Seeking revenge after a bad review or being fired.
* **The Malicious Insider:** Paid by a competitor or nation-state to steal secrets.
* **The Unintentional Insider:** An employee who makes a mistake (e.g., clicking a phishing link).
* **Exam Tip:** To stop insiders, use **Least Privilege**, **Separation of Duties**, and **Mandatory Vacations**.

---

## 6. Organized Crime

These are professional "businesses" of hacking.

* **Goal:** Purely financial. They want your credit cards, your customer database, or your ransom money.
* **Attribute:** They are the primary drivers of the **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)** industry. They are highly organized, with "help desks" for victims to pay ransoms.

---

## 7. Shadow IT

Shadow IT refers to employees who use software, hardware, or cloud services without the IT department's knowledge or approval.

* **Is it a "Threat"?** Yes. While the employee’s motivation is usually **efficiency** (just trying to get work done), it creates massive vulnerabilities because these systems aren't patched, backed up, or monitored by security.
* **Example:** Storing sensitive corporate data in a personal Dropbox account because the company's file share is "too slow."

## Summary for the Exam

* **If it's about Politics:** It's a **Hacktivist**.
* **If it's about Geopolitics/Espionage:** It's a **Nation-State**.
* **If it's about pure Profit:** It's **Organized Crime**.
* **If it's about unauthorized cloud apps:** It's **Shadow IT**.
