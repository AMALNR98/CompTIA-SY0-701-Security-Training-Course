## 1. States of Data and Encryption Methods

Before choosing an algorithm, you must identify where the data is. The exam focuses on three specific states:

### A. Data-at-Rest (Stored Data)

This refers to data physically residing on storage media (HDDs, SSDs, Tapes, Cloud Buckets).

* **Full Disk Encryption (FDE):** Encrypts the entire drive, including the OS. Examples: **BitLocker** (Windows), **FileVault** (macOS).
* **Partition Encryption:** Encrypts only a specific section of a drive.
* **File/Folder Encryption:** Encrypts individual files. If a file is moved to an unencrypted drive, it remains encrypted.
* **Self-Encrypting Drives (SED):** Hardware-based encryption where the drive controller handles the process, reducing the load on the CPU.

### B. Database Encryption

Database security requires more granular control than simple disk encryption because different users need different levels of access.

* **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE):** Encrypts the actual database files on the hard drive. It protects the data "at rest" but is decrypted automatically when the DB engine reads it.
* **Column-Level Encryption:** Allows you to encrypt specific sensitive fields (like Social Security Numbers or Credit Card info) while leaving other data (like Customer Names) searchable.
* **Cell-Level Encryption:** The most granular; encrypts a single "cell" or data point.

### C. Data-in-Transit (Transport Encryption)

Data moving across a network (Internal or Internet).

* **TLS (Transport Layer Security):** The successor to SSL. It secures web traffic (HTTPS), email (IMAP/SMTP over TLS), and VPNs.
* **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security):** Often used for site-to-site VPNs. It encrypts data at the IP layer.
* **SSH (Secure Shell):** Replaces Telnet; used for secure remote management of Linux servers and network gear.

## 2. Encryption Algorithms Deep Dive

You must distinguish between **Symmetric** (One Key) and **Asymmetric** (Key Pair) algorithms based on their use cases.

### Symmetric Algorithms (Fast, Bulk Data)

| Algorithm | Key Size | Notes for Exam |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** | 128, 192, 256-bit | The "Gold Standard." Used for FDE, WPA3, and government secrets. Extremely secure. |
| **DES / 3DES** | 56-bit / 168-bit | **Legacy.** DES is cracked. 3DES is being phased out (deprecated) due to slowness and vulnerability. |
| **Blowfish / Twofish** | 32 to 448-bit | Blowfish is fast; Twofish was an AES finalist. Both are public domain (no royalties). |
| **ChaCha20** | 256-bit | Often used in mobile devices and Google services because it is faster than AES on hardware without AES acceleration. |

### Asymmetric Algorithms (Slow, Key Exchange)

| Algorithm | Type | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **RSA** | Prime Factorization | Used for digital signatures and encrypting small amounts of data (like a symmetric key). |
| **ECC (Elliptic Curve)** | Mathematical Curves | **High Efficiency.** Provides the same security as RSA but with much smaller keys. Perfect for mobile/IoT. |
| **Diffie-Hellman (DH)** | Key Exchange | Does **not** encrypt data. It is a method for two parties to safely create a shared symmetric key over an insecure channel. |

---

## 3. Key Concepts: Modes and Strengths

* **Cipher Suites:** A collection of algorithms (Key Exchange + Bulk Encryption + Hashing) used in a TLS connection. (Example: `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`).
* **Entropy:** The measure of randomness in a key. Low entropy makes a key predictable and hackable.
* **Key Stretching:** A technique to make a weak password harder to crack by running it through a hashing function thousands of times (e.g., **bcrypt**, **PBKDF2**).

## 4. Technical Comparison: RSA vs. ECC

This is a high-probability exam topic regarding resource-constrained devices.

| Feature | **RSA** | **ECC** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Computational Overhead** | High | Low |
| **Key Size (Equivalent Security)** | 3072-bit | 256-bit |
| **Best For** | Desktop/Server Power | Mobile, IoT, Smart Cards |

---

## 5. Security Summary Table

| Goal | Best Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Protecting a stolen laptop's data** | Full Disk Encryption (AES-256) |
| **Protecting login credentials over Wi-Fi** | TLS (HTTPS) |
| **Ensuring an admin can recover data** | Key Escrow / Recovery Agent |
| **Highly secure database field** | Column-Level Encryption |

> **Exam Tip:** If the question mentions **"Resource Constrained"** or **"Mobile Devices,"** look for **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**. If it mentions **"Legacy Support,"** look for **3DES**, but remember it's no longer recommended.

## 1. DES (Data Encryption Standard)

DES was the world standard for decades, but it is now considered **insecure** and should never be used in a modern security architecture.

### Key Characteristics:

* **Key Size:** 56-bit key. This is its fatal flaw. With modern computing power, a 56-bit key can be "brute-forced" in less than a day.
* **Block Size:** 64-bit blocks.
* **Structure:** Feistel Network (it splits the data into two halves and performs multiple rounds of substitution and permutation).
* **Legacy Status:** You will only see DES mentioned in the exam as an example of what **not** to use, or in the context of legacy systems that cannot be upgraded.

### The "Band-Aid" Solution: 3DES (Triple DES)

To extend the life of DES, 3DES was created. It runs the DES algorithm three times over each block of data.

* **Key Size:** Effectively 168-bit (56 x 3).
* **The Downside:** It is incredibly **slow** because it performs triple the work. It is also vulnerable to "Sweet32" attacks because of its small 64-bit block size.
* **Exam Note:** 3DES is officially **deprecated** and being phased out.

---

## 2. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

AES replaced DES in 2001 and remains the most secure and widely used symmetric algorithm in the world today.

### Key Characteristics:

* **Key Sizes:** 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit. Even a 128-bit AES key is mathematically impossible to brute-force with current technology.
* **Block Size:** 128-bit blocks (larger than DES, making it more secure against birthday attacks).
* **Structure:** Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN). It processes the entire block as a single unit rather than splitting it.
* **Efficiency:** Extremely fast in both hardware and software. Most modern CPUs have **AES-NI** (New Instructions) built-in to handle this encryption at the hardware level.

## 3. Technical Comparison Table

| Feature | **DES (Legacy)** | **AES (Modern Standard)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Year Standardized** | 1977 | 2001 |
| **Key Length** | 56-bit | 128, 192, or 256-bit |
| **Block Size** | 64-bit | 128-bit |
| **Security Status** | **Broken / Insecure** | **Strong / Secure** |
| **Performance** | Fast (but weak) | Very Fast (and strong) |
| **Algorithm Type** | Symmetric (Block) | Symmetric (Block) |
| **Common Uses** | None (except legacy) | WPA3, BitLocker, TLS, File Vault |

---

## 4. Encryption Modes (Technical Nuance)

The algorithm (AES) is the "engine," but the **Mode of Operation** is how it handles multiple blocks of data. The SY0-701 may ask about these:

* **Electronic Code Book (ECB):** The simplest and **weakest** mode. It encrypts each block with the same key identically. This results in patterns appearing in the ciphertext. **Do not use for images or complex data.**
* **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):** Each block is "chained" to the one before it using an **Initialization Vector (IV)**. This hides patterns but must be processed sequentially (slower).
* **Galois/Counter Mode (GCM):** The "Gold Standard" for modern encryption (used in HTTPS). It provides both **Confidentiality** and **Integrity** (Authentication) in one pass. It is highly efficient and supports parallel processing.

---

## 5. Summary for the Exam

* **Scenario:** You are asked to select an algorithm for a new government database.
* **Answer:** **AES-256**.


* **Scenario:** You are performing a vulnerability scan and find a server using DES.
* **Answer:** Flag it as a **Critical Vulnerability**; it must be upgraded to AES.


* **Scenario:** Why is AES preferred over 3DES?
* **Answer:** AES is both **more secure** and **significantly faster**.



> **Pro Tip:** In any "Multiple Choice" question on the exam, if you see "DES" or "WEP" as an answer for a *current* security solution, they are almost certainly "distractors" (wrong answers).

## 1. Cryptographic Keys

A key is a string of bits used by a cryptographic algorithm to transform plain text into ciphertext (or vice versa).

### Key Characteristics for the Exam:

* **Entropy:** The measure of randomness in a key. High entropy means the key is unpredictable and resistant to "pattern-matching" attacks.
* **Keyspace:** The total number of possible combinations for a key. If a key is 3 bits long, the keyspace is . If it is 128 bits, the keyspace is  (astronomically large).
* **Ephemeral Keys:** These are temporary keys used for a single session. If the session ends, the key is destroyed. This provides **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)**—even if a server's long-term private key is stolen later, the thief cannot decrypt past sessions.

---

## 2. Key Lengths (Strengths)

The exam requires you to know which key lengths are considered secure for different types of encryption. Generally, **Asymmetric** keys must be much longer than **Symmetric** keys to provide the same level of security because they are based on mathematical problems that are easier to attack.

| Encryption Type | Algorithm | Minimum Secure Length | Recommended Length |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Symmetric** | AES | 128-bit | 256-bit |
| **Asymmetric** | RSA | 2048-bit | 3072-bit or higher |
| **Asymmetric** | ECC | 256-bit | 384-bit |

### Why is ECC different?

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) uses complex mathematical curves. This allows it to achieve high security with very small keys. For example, a **256-bit ECC key** is roughly equivalent in strength to a **3072-bit RSA key**.

* **Exam Use Case:** Use ECC for mobile devices, smart cards, and IoT where battery life and CPU power are limited.

---

## 3. Key Stretching

Key stretching is a technique used to make a weak password stronger against **Brute-Force** and **Rainbow Table** attacks. It works by putting the password through a mathematical "loop" thousands of times.

### How it Works:

1. A user creates a password (e.g., "P@ssword123").
2. The system adds a **Salt** (random data) to the password.
3. The system hashes the password.
4. The system takes that hash and hashes it again... and again... and again (often 10,000+ times).
5. **The Result:** Even if an attacker has a list of billions of hashes, it takes them significantly longer to check each password because their computer has to do the 10,000 calculations for every single guess.

### Common Key Stretching Libraries:

* **Bcrypt:** Based on the Blowfish cipher; specifically designed to be slow to frustrate attackers.
* **PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2):** Part of the RSA standards; it applies a HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) to the password many times.
* **Argon2:** The modern winner of the Password Hashing Competition; highly resistant to GPU-based cracking.

## 4. Key Management Lifecycle

Keys have a "lifespan." You must know these phases for the SY0-701:

1. **Generation:** Creating the key using a strong random number generator.
2. **Storage:** Keeping keys in a **Hardware Security Module (HSM)** or a **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)** chip.
3. **Distribution:** Safely sending the key to the authorized user (often via Diffie-Hellman).
4. **Revocation:** Canceling a key before it expires (e.g., if a laptop is stolen).
5. **Expiration:** Keys should always have a "Best Before" date to limit the time an attacker has to crack them.
6. **Destruction:** Overwriting the key so it can never be recovered.

## Summary Comparison for the Exam

| Term | Strategy | Best Used For... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Salting** | Adding random bits to a password. | Preventing Rainbow Table attacks. |
| **Stretching** | Running hash functions in a loop. | Slowing down Brute-Force attacks. |
| **Escrow** | Storing a key with a 3rd party. | Ensuring management can recover data. |
| **Perfect Forward Secrecy** | Using Ephemeral Keys. | Protecting past data if a key is stolen. |

> **Exam Tip:** If a question describes an attacker using a massive list of pre-calculated hashes to crack passwords, the answer to "How to prevent this?" is **Salting**. If the question asks how to make a password "computationally expensive" to crack, the answer is **Key Stretching**.
