## 1. Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption

The primary difference is the number of keys involved.

| Feature | **Symmetric Encryption** | **Asymmetric Encryption** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Key Count** | One (1) Private/Shared Key | Two (2) Related Keys (Public & Private) |
| **Speed** | Very Fast | Slow (Resource intensive) |
| **Usage** | Bulk data encryption (Hard drives) | Key exchange, Digital Signatures |
| **Common Alg.** | AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish | RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman |

## 2. The Key Pair (Asymmetric)

In Asymmetric encryption, keys work in a mathematical partnership. If one key locks the data, only the other can unlock it.

* **Public Key:** Shared with everyone. Used to **Encrypt** data for the owner or **Verify** the owner's signature.
* **Private Key:** Kept secret by the owner. Used to **Decrypt** data or **Sign** (create) a digital signature.

> **The Golden Rule for the Exam:** > * To send a **secret** to Bob: Encrypt with **Bob's Public Key**.
> * To **sign** a message as Bob: Encrypt with **Bob's Private Key**.

## 3. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

PKI is the "trust hierarchy" that manages, distributes, and revokes digital certificates. It proves that a specific public key belongs to a specific person/entity.

### Core Components:

* **Certificate Authority (CA):** The ultimate source of trust. It signs and issues certificates.
* **Registration Authority (RA):** The "assistant" to the CA. It verifies the identity of the person requesting a certificate before the CA issues it.
* **Certificate Revocation List (CRL):** A "blacklist" of certificates that are no longer valid (e.g., if a private key was stolen).
* **OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol):** A faster, real-time way to check if a certificate is still valid instead of downloading a whole CRL.

## 4. Key Escrow

Key Escrow is a **Managerial/Technical control** where a copy of encryption keys is held by a trusted third party or a centralized management system.

* **The Purpose:** If an employee leaves the company or loses their password, the organization can recover the encrypted data.
* **The Risk:** If the Escrow database is hacked, the attacker has the keys to *everything*.
* **Recovery Agent:** The specific person/role authorized to "pull" a key out of escrow.

## Summary Table: Key Management Concepts

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Key Exchange** | Using Asymmetric encryption to safely share a Symmetric key. |
| **Ephemeral Key** | A temporary key used for only one session (Perfect Forward Secrecy). |
| **Digital Certificate** | A digital document (X.509) containing the public key and owner info. |
| **CSR** | Certificate Signing Request; what you send to a CA to get a certificate. |
