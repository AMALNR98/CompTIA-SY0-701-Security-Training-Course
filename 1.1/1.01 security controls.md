## 1. Security Control Categories

The "Category" describes the entity or mechanism implementing the control.

| **Category** | **Definition** | **Examples** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Technical (Logical)** | Controls implemented through hardware, software, or technical systems. | Firewalls, Encryption, Antivirus, IDS/IPS, MFA. |
| **Managerial (Administrative)** | Controls that focus on risk management and governance. Often "on paper." | Security policies, Risk assessments, Laws, Strategic planning. |
| **Operational** | Day-to-day security procedures executed by **people**. | Security training, Guard patrols, Log reviews, Onboarding. |
| **Physical** | Tangible barriers that protect real-world assets and facilities. | Fences, Locks, CCTV cameras, Bollards, Badges. |

## 2. Security Control Types

The "Type" defines the function or purpose of the control—specifically **when** it acts in relation to an incident.

| **Type** | **Function / Purpose** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Preventive** | Stops a security incident before it happens. | Firewall blocking a port; A physical door lock. |
| **Deterrent** | Discourages an attacker from attempting an exploit. | "Trespassers will be prosecuted" sign; Fake cameras. |
| **Detective** | Identifies that an incident has occurred or is in progress. | Motion sensors; Log files; Intrusion Detection (IDS). |
| **Corrective** | Repairs the damage and restores systems after an attack. | Restoring from a backup; Patching a vulnerability. |
| **Compensating** | A backup measure used when the primary control isn't feasible. | Using a security guard if the electronic badge reader breaks. |
| **Directive** | Sets the rules and mandates behavior. | An Acceptable Use Policy (AUP); Standard Operating Procedures. |

## 3. The "Control Matrix" (Scenarios)

CompTIA often asks scenarios where you must identify both the Category and Type. Use this table as a "Cheat Sheet":

| Scenario | Category | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A login banner warning of monitoring** | Technical | Deterrent |
| **Hiring a security guard to check IDs** | Operational | Preventive |
| **Implementing a Fire Extinguisher** | Physical | Corrective |
| **Reviewing Audit Logs once a week** | Managerial | Detective |
| **Adding a UPS (Power) during an outage** | Physical | Compensating |
