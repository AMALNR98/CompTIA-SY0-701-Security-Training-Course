**Social Engineering**. Social engineering is the "art" of manipulating people into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. It exploits human psychology rather than technical flaws.

## 1. Phishing: The Foundation

Phishing is a broad term for sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source.

* **Bulk Phishing:** Sending thousands of generic emails (e.g., "Your Netflix account is suspended") hoping a small percentage of people click.
* **Spear Phishing:** A targeted attack aimed at a specific individual or department. The attacker researches the target (often via LinkedIn/Social Media) to make the email highly convincing.
* **Whaling:** A spear phishing attack specifically targeting "big fish" like the CEO, CFO, or high-level executives.

## 2. Business Email Compromise (BEC)

BEC is a specific, highly sophisticated form of spear phishing that targets organizations with the goal of financial fraud.

* **The Mechanism:** The attacker gains access to a legitimate business email account (through credential harvesting) or uses a **look-alike domain** (e.g., `invoice@microsoft-support.com` instead of `microsoft.com`).
* **The Goal:** Usually involves **wire transfer fraud**. The attacker might impersonate a known vendor and send an "updated" invoice with new bank account details.
* **Why it works:** It lacks the obvious "spammy" look of bulk phishing. It often relies on a pre-existing trust relationship.

## 3. Phishing with Different "Bait" (Alternative Vectors)

Attackers adapt their "bait" based on the platform the user is most likely to trust at that moment.

| Type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SMS** | **Smishing** | Phishing via text message. Often uses "Package Delivery" or "Bank Alert" themes. |
| **Voice** | **Vishing** | Voice phishing. Attackers use VoIP to spoof caller IDs and impersonate IT support or government agencies. |
| **QR Code** | **Quishing** | Users scan a malicious QR code (e.g., on a parking meter or a fake menu) that leads to a credential-harvesting site. |
| **Instant Message** | **SPIM** | Spam over Instant Messaging (Slack, Teams, WhatsApp). |

## 4. Tricks and Misdirection

Social engineers use "Cognitive Biases" to bypass a user's critical thinking. The exam focuses on these **Social Engineering Principles**:

* **Authority:** The attacker pretends to be a CEO, a police officer, or an IRS agent. People are conditioned to obey authority.
* **Urgency:** "Act now or your account will be deleted in 2 hours!" This prevents the user from taking the time to verify the claim.
* **Scarcity:** "Only 5 prizes left!" used to rush the victim into a decision.
* **Social Proof (Consensus):** "All your coworkers have already signed the new policy."
* **Likability/Flattery:** An attacker might spend time "grooming" a target by being friendly or helpful before asking for a favor (the exploit).
* **Fear:** Threatening legal action or embarrassing consequences if the victim doesn't comply.

## 5. Technical Misdirection (The "Fake" UI)

* **Typosquatting / URL Hijacking:** Registering domains that are common misspellings of popular sites (e.g., `gogle.com`).
* **Homograph Attack:** Using characters from different alphabets that look identical to Latin characters (e.g., replacing a Latin 'o' with a Cyrillic 'о') to create a deceptive URL.
* **Prepend / Append:** Adding extra words to a trusted domain (e.g., `paypal-security-update.com`).

## Summary for the Exam

* **BEC vs. Phishing:** BEC is specifically about **business processes/wire transfers**; Phishing is the general method.
* **Quishing:** If a question mentions a **physical sticker** or a **menu**, it's likely Quishing.
* **Vishing:** If the scenario involves a **phone call** or **VoIP**, it's Vishing.
* **Mitigation:** The #1 defense against social engineering is **Security Awareness Training**.
