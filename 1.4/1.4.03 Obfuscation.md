## 1. Obfuscation

Obfuscation is the process of making something difficult to understand or "hidden in plain sight." In cybersecurity, it is most commonly applied to **source code**.

* **Purpose:** To prevent reverse-engineering. If a hacker steals your software, obfuscation makes the code so messy and confusing that they cannot find vulnerabilities or steal your intellectual property.
* **Techniques:**
* **Renaming:** Changing variables from `password_admin` to `a1_z9`.
* **Dead Code Injection:** Adding useless code that does nothing but distract the reader.
* **String Transformation:** Scrambling text strings so they only decrypt at runtime.

## 2. Steganography

Steganography is the art of **hiding messages inside other non-secret data**. Unlike encryption (which hides the *meaning*), steganography hides the *existence* of the message.

### Common Steganography Techniques

| Technique | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **LSB (Least Significant Bit)** | Most common. The "end" bits of a pixel's color value in an image are changed to store text bits. The change is so tiny the human eye can't see it. |
| **Digital Watermarking** | Hiding a unique ID in media (audio/video) to track ownership or copyright. |
| **Social Steganography** | Hiding a message in a public social media post (e.g., the first letter of every word spells a secret). |

### Other Steganographic Techniques

* **Invisible Ink/Metadata:** Hiding data in the "Exif" data of a photo or in the "white space" of a document file.
* **Frequency Domain:** Hiding data in the sound frequencies of an MP3 file that the human ear cannot perceive.
* **Network Steganography:** Hiding data inside the headers of network packets (like the TCP Sequence numbers).

## 3. Tokenization

Tokenization is a security process where a sensitive data element (like a credit card number) is replaced by a non-sensitive equivalent, called a **Token**.

* **The Difference from Encryption:** Encryption uses a mathematical algorithm to scramble data. Tokenization uses a **randomly generated value** and a secure **Token Vault** (a database that maps the token back to the real data).
* **Benefit:** The token has no mathematical relationship to the original data. If a hacker steals a list of tokens, they are worthless without access to the Token Vault.
* **Use Case:** Apple Pay or credit card processing. The merchant never sees your real card number, only a one-time "token."

## 4. Data Masking (De-identification)

Data masking creates a version of the data that looks real but hides the sensitive parts. This is vital for developers or testers who need real-looking data without seeing actual customer secrets.

### Types of Data Masking

| Type | How it Works | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Static Masking** | A permanent copy of the database is made, and sensitive fields are scrubbed. | Replacing all real names with "John Doe." |
| **Dynamic Masking** | Data is masked "on the fly" as it is requested from the database. | A customer rep sees `XXXX-XXXX-1234` instead of the full credit card number. |
| **Substitution** | Replacing real values with fake but realistic values from a list. | Swapping real zip codes with other random zip codes. |
| **Shuffling** | Swapping values within the same column. | Moving Employee A's salary to Employee B's record. |

## Technical Comparison: Encryption vs. Tokenization vs. Masking

| Feature | Encryption | Tokenization | Data Masking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mechanism** | Mathematical Algorithm | Random Replacement | Character Substitution |
| **Reversible?** | Yes (with a Key) | Yes (with the Vault) | Often No (Static) |
| **Data Format** | Changes (Ciphertext) | Stays the same | Stays the same |
| **Primary Goal** | Confidentiality in transit | Security in storage/PCI | Privacy for testing |

## Summary for the Exam

* **Scenario:** A company needs developers to test a database containing real customer names without seeing the names.
* **Answer:** **Data Masking**.


* **Scenario:** A hacker hides a malicious script inside a legitimate `.jpg` file.
* **Answer:** **Steganography**.


* **Scenario:** A web app wants to prevent competitors from reading its Javascript code.
* **Answer:** **Obfuscation**.


* **Scenario:** A retailer wants to store credit cards without having to meet strict PCI-DSS audit requirements for all their servers.
* **Answer:** **Tokenization** (since they aren't storing the actual card data).
