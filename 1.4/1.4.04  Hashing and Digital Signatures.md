## 1. Cryptographic Hashes

A hash is a "digital fingerprint." It takes an input of any size and produces a fixed-length string of characters.

### Key Characteristics:

* **One-Way (Non-reversible):** You can go from the "Data" to the "Hash," but you can never mathematically turn the "Hash" back into the original "Data."
* **Deterministic:** The same input will *always* produce the exact same hash.
* **Avalanche Effect:** If you change even one single bit of the input (like changing a period to an exclamation mark), the entire hash output changes completely.

### Common Hash Algorithms

| Algorithm | Digest Size | Security Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MD5** | 128-bit | **Broken.** Vulnerable to collisions. Used only for basic integrity checks. |
| **SHA-1** | 160-bit | **Legacy.** Being phased out; vulnerabilities found. |
| **SHA-256** | 256-bit | **Standard.** Currently considered very secure and widely used in TLS and Bitcoin. |
| **SHA-3** | Varies | **Modern.** Uses a different internal structure (Keccak) to resist future attacks. |

## 2. Collision and Birthday Attacks

A **Collision** occurs when two *different* pieces of data produce the *exact same* hash.

* **The Risk:** An attacker could replace a legitimate file with a malicious one that has the same hash, tricking the system into thinking the file is safe.
* **The Birthday Attack:** A mathematical phenomenon where the probability of finding a collision increases much faster than you’d expect (based on the "Birthday Paradox"). This is why we move to larger hash sizes like SHA-256—to make the keyspace too large for a collision to be found.

## 3. Practical Hashing: Salting the Hash

If two people have the same password, "password123," they will have the same hash. Hackers use **Rainbow Tables** (pre-computed lists of hashes) to crack these instantly.

### Salting

A **Salt** is random data added to a password *before* it is hashed.

* **The Process:** .
* **The Result:** Even if two people use the same password, their hashes will look completely different because their salts are unique. This makes Rainbow Tables useless and forces the attacker to crack each password individually, which is much slower.

## 4. Digital Signatures

A digital signature is a mathematical way to prove **Authenticity**, **Integrity**, and **Non-repudiation** (the sender cannot deny they sent it).

### Creating a Digital Signature (The "Math" of Trust)

This is a high-probability exam topic. Remember: **You sign with your Private Key, and others verify with your Public Key.**

1. **Hasing:** The sender (Alice) takes her message and runs it through a hashing algorithm (like SHA-256) to get a **Hash Digest**.
2. **Signing:** Alice encrypts that **Hash Digest** with her **Private Key**. This encrypted hash is the **Digital Signature**.
3. **Sending:** Alice sends the original message + the Digital Signature to Bob.
4. **Verification:**
* Bob hashes the message he received to get his own "local" hash.
* Bob decrypts Alice's signature using Alice's **Public Key** to reveal her hash.
* **The Match:** If Bob's local hash matches Alice's decrypted hash, he knows the message wasn't changed (Integrity) and that it definitely came from Alice (Authenticity).

## Summary Comparison Table

| Term | Goal | Key/Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hashing** | Integrity | Algorithm (SHA-256) |
| **Salting** | Password Security | Random Data + Hash |
| **Digital Signature** | Non-repudiation | Private Key (Sign) / Public Key (Verify) |
| **HMAC** | Integrity + Auth | Hash + Secret Key |

> **Exam Tip:** If the question mentions **Non-repudiation**, the answer is almost always **Digital Signatures**. If it asks how to stop **Rainbow Tables**, the answer is **Salting**.
