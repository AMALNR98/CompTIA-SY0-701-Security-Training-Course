## 1. Gap Analysis Overview

A Gap Analysis answers two fundamental questions: **"Where are we now?"** and **"Where do we need to be?"**

* **Current State:** The existing security controls, policies, and technical implementations.
* **Target State:** The "ideal" state defined by compliance requirements (like HIPAA) or industry standards (like NIST).
* **The "Gap":** The specific deficiencies or missing controls that create risk.

## 2. Step 1: Choosing a Framework

You cannot perform a gap analysis without a "yardstick" to measure against. Organizations choose frameworks based on their industry and goals:

| **Framework** | **Best For...** |
| --- | --- |
| **NIST CSF** | General cybersecurity improvement (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover). |
| **ISO/IEC 27001** | International standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). |
| **PCI DSS** | Any organization handling credit card data. |
| **CIS Benchmarks** | Specific technical configurations for hardening systems. |
| **SOC2** | Service providers managing customer data in the cloud. |

## 3. Step 2: Evaluate People and Processes

A gap analysis isn't just about checking firewall settings; it must evaluate the entire security ecosystem.

* **People:** Do employees have the necessary skills? Is there a security awareness program? Are roles like the CISO clearly defined?
* **Processes:** Are there documented policies for Incident Response? Is the Change Management process followed?
* **Technology:** Are the technical controls (MFA, Encryption, EDR) actually deployed and configured correctly?

## 4. Step 3: Compare and Contrast

During this phase, the auditor or security team performs a "cross-walk."

* **Mapping:** You take a requirement from the framework (e.g., "MFA must be used for all remote access") and contrast it with your current reality (e.g., "Only 40% of users use MFA").
* **Identify the Delta:** The difference (the 60% of users without MFA) is the gap.

## 5. The Analysis and the Report

The final stage is documenting the findings into a **Gap Analysis Report**. This report is used by management to justify budget and prioritize projects.

### Components of the Report:

1. **Executive Summary:** High-level view for stakeholders.
2. **Gap Identification:** A detailed list of every missing or weak control.
3. **Risk Assessment:** How dangerous is each gap? (High/Medium/Low).
4. **Remediation Plan (Roadmap):** A step-by-step guide on how to close the gaps, including estimated costs and timelines.

## Gap Analysis vs. Risk Assessment

The exam may try to confuse these two.

| **Feature** | **Gap Analysis** | **Risk Assessment** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Focus** | Comparison against a standard. | Identification of threats and vulnerabilities. |
| **Goal** | Compliance and "best practice" alignment. | Determining the likelihood and impact of an attack. |
| **Output** | A list of missing controls. | A prioritized list of risks to be mitigated. |

> **Exam Tip:** If a question asks about "identifying the difference between current security and a specific regulatory standard," the answer is **Gap Analysis**.
