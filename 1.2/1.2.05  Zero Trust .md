**Zero Trust** is treated not just as a tool, but as a complete shift in security philosophy. It moves away from the "Castle and Moat" (perimeter) defense toward a model where **location does not equal trust.**

## 1. Zero Trust: Functional Planes of Operation

To implement Zero Trust, the architecture is split into two distinct functional planes. This separation ensures that the "brain" (policy) is separate from the "muscle" (execution).

* **Control Plane:** The administrative layer. It is responsible for **authenticating** users and devices, and **making decisions** on whether access should be granted.
* *Components:* Policy Engine, Policy Administrator.


* **Data Plane:** The operational layer. This is where the actual communication between the user (Subject) and the resource (System) happens.
* *Components:* Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), network switches, and firewalls.

## 2. Core Components: Controlling Trust

The Zero Trust model relies on three specific logical entities to manage access requests:

| Component | Role | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Policy Engine (PE)** | The Decision Maker | Evaluates the request against security policies (e.g., Is the user in the right country? Is their device patched?). |
| **Policy Administrator (PA)** | The Gatekeeper | Executes the decision of the Engine. It creates or shuts down the communication path. |
| **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)** | The Guard | The physical or virtual "fence" (like a firewall or gateway) that actually stays in the data path to allow or block traffic. |

> **Note:** The PE and PA together are often referred to as the **Policy Decision Point (PDP)**.

## 3. Security Zones and Microsegmentation

Zero Trust removes "Implicit Trust Zones" (the idea that once you are inside the office, you are safe).

* **Microsegmentation:** Breaking the network into very small, isolated zones (sometimes down to a single application). This reduces the **Blast Radius**—if one server is hacked, the attacker cannot "lateral move" to another.
* **Security Zones:** Instead of "Inside" vs "Outside," zones are defined by the **sensitivity of the data**. You might have a "PCI Zone" for credit cards and a "Public Zone" for the website.

## 4. Applying Trust in the Planes

Trust is never permanent. In the functional planes, trust is applied using **Adaptive Identity**:

1. **Context-Aware:** The system checks the time of day, IP address, and behavior.
2. **Continuous Monitoring:** Trust is re-evaluated mid-session. If a user’s behavior suddenly looks like an attack, the Control Plane tells the Data Plane to sever the connection immediately.

## 5. Extending the Physical Architecture

Zero Trust allows you to extend security beyond the physical office walls. Since you are not relying on a physical network cable for trust, you can securely include:

* **Cloud Resources:** Treating AWS/Azure servers as part of your internal "Trusted" ecosystem.
* **Remote Workers:** Using a **Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP)** to create a private "tunnel" for one specific user to one specific app.
* **IoT Devices:** Isolating "smart" devices (which are often unpatchable) into their own restricted security zones.
