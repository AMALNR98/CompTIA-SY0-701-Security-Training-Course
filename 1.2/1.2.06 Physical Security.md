## 1. Physical Barriers and Deterrents

These controls focus on the perimeter and keeping unauthorized vehicles or people out.

| Control | Function / Description | Category | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Bollards** | Short, sturdy vertical posts designed to stop a vehicle from ramming into a building. | Physical | Preventive |
| **Barricades** | General term for walls or fences that channel people to specific access points. | Physical | Preventive |
| **Fencing** | Physical boundary. High fences prevent climbing; barbed wire adds a deterrent layer. | Physical | Preventive / Deterrent |
| **Lighting** | Eliminates hiding spots. Well-lit areas increase the "perceived risk" for an intruder. | Physical | Deterrent |

## 2. Advanced Access Controls

These mechanisms focus on **who** is entering a specific door or room.

### Access Control Vestibules (Mantraps)

This is a critical exam topic. A vestibule is a small room with two interlocking doors.

* **Mechanism:** Door A must close and lock before Door B can unlock.
* **Security Purpose:** Prevents **Tailgating** (someone following an authorized person) and **Piggybacking**.
* **Integration:** Often requires two different factors (e.g., Badge for Door A, Fingerprint for Door B).

### Guards and Access Badges

* **Guards (Operational Control):** Provide human judgment. They can challenge suspicious behavior and verify guest identities.
* **Access Badges (RFID/Proximity):** Used to unlock electronic doors.
* **Proximity Cards:** Use NFC or RFID to "tap" or wave at a reader.
* **Smart Cards:** Contain a microchip for higher security and "something you have" authentication.

## 3. Monitoring and Detection

Once the perimeter is breached, these controls identify the activity.

| Control | Description | Exam Context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Video Surveillance (CCTV)** | Cameras used to monitor and record activity. | **Detective** (records the event) and **Deterrent** (if cameras are visible). |
| **Infrared (IR) Sensors** | Detects heat signatures. | Used for "Night Vision" or to detect humans in total darkness. |
| **Motion Sensors** | Detects physical movement via infrared, microwave, or ultrasonic waves. | Triggers an alarm or turns on lights (**Detective**). |
| **Pressure Sensors** | Triggers an alarm when weight is detected on a specific floor mat or surface. | Often used in front of high-value assets like safes. |

## Summary Comparison: Deterrent vs. Detective

| **Deterrent** (Discourages) | **Detective** (Identifies) |
| --- | --- |
| Signs ("No Trespassing") | Motion Sensors |
| Visible Cameras | Log Files (Audit logs) |
| Fencing / Barbed Wire | Alarms / Sirens |
| Bright Lighting | CCTV Recording |
