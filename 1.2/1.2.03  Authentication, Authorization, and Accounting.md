## 1. The AAA Framework

AAA is the standard architecture for controlling access to network resources. Think of it as the "workflow" of security.

| **Component** | **Question it Answers** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Authentication** | "Who are you?" | Verifying credentials (passwords, biometrics, or certificates) to prove identity. |
| **Authorization** | "What can you do?" | Granting or denying access to specific resources based on permissions/roles. |
| **Accounting** | "What did you do?" | Logging activity, tracking resource usage, and creating audit trails for compliance. |

## 2. Certificate Authentication vs. Certificate-Based Authentication (CBA)

While often used interchangeably, the SY0-701 exam looks for your understanding of how certificates replace or augment traditional passwords.

### Certificate-Based Authentication (CBA)

This is a **passwordless** method. Instead of entering a secret string of characters, the system uses **Asymmetric Cryptography**.

* **The Process:** The user (client) presents a digital certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The server sends a "challenge," which the client signs with their **Private Key**. The server verifies the signature using the **Public Key** inside the certificate.
* **Benefits:** Phishing-resistant, no password fatigue, and highly secure for machine-to-machine communication.

### Key Concepts for the Exam:

* **Proof of Possession:** The user must prove they own the **Private Key** associated with the certificate.
* **Trust Anchors:** Both the client and server must trust the **Root CA** that signed the certificates.

## 3. Authorization Models

The exam distinguishes between systems that simply let everyone in ("No Authorization") and those that use structured models to limit access.

### No Authorization Model

In this scenario, once a user is authenticated, they have full access to everything (common in very small, flat networks). This violates the **Principle of Least Privilege**.

### Using an Authorization Model (Structured Access)

Modern security requires a specific model to manage permissions effectively:

| **Model** | **How it Works** | **Best For...** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **RBAC (Role-Based)** | Access is based on job function (e.g., "Manager" vs. "Auditor"). | Large organizations with defined roles. |
| **ABAC (Attribute-Based)** | Access is based on "Attributes" (e.g., Time of day, IP address, Department). | Granular, context-aware security (Zero Trust). |
| **MAC (Mandatory)** | Data is labeled (Secret, Top Secret). Users need a matching clearance. | Military or high-security government use. |
| **DAC (Discretionary)** | The "Owner" of the file decides who gets access. | Social media or flexible file-sharing environments. |

## 4. Authentication Summary Table

| Method | Authentication Factor | Security Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Username/Password** | Something you know | Low (Easy to phish/crack) |
| **Digital Certificate** | Something you have (Private Key) | High (Phishing-resistant) |
| **Smart Card** | Something you have + PIN | Very High (Multi-factor) |

> **Exam Tip:** If a question asks for the **most secure** way to authenticate a remote user while preventing phishing, look for **Certificate-based Authentication** or **FIDO2/WebAuthn**.
