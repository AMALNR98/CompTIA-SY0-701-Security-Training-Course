## The CIA Triad Breakdown

The goal of any security professional is to maintain these three pillars. If one is broken, the system is no longer "secure."

### 1. Confidentiality (The "Secrecy" Pillar)

**Definition:** Ensuring that sensitive data is only accessed by authorized individuals, processes, or systems.

* **Goal:** Prevent unauthorized disclosure (e.g., data breaches or snooping).
* **Primary Tools:** * **Encryption:** Scrambling data (AES, RSA).
* **Access Control:** Permissions and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
* **Masking:** Hiding sensitive parts of data (e.g., hiding all but the last 4 digits of a credit card).



### 2. Integrity (The "Accuracy" Pillar)

**Definition:** Ensuring that data remains accurate, consistent, and has not been altered by an unauthorized party.

* **Goal:** Prevent unauthorized modification or data corruption.
* **Primary Tools:**
* **Hashing:** Creating a unique digital fingerprint of a file (SHA-256). If the hash changes, the data was tampered with.
* **Digital Signatures:** Proving who sent the data and that it hasn't changed.
* **Version Control:** Tracking changes over time.



### 3. Availability (The "Access" Pillar)

**Definition:** Ensuring that authorized users have reliable and timely access to data and resources when needed.

* **Goal:** Prevent downtime from hardware failure, human error, or attacks like DDoS.
* **Primary Tools:**
* **Redundancy:** Using multiple servers or power supplies (RAID, Load Balancing).
* **Backups:** Having copies of data stored elsewhere.
* **Patching:** Keeping systems updated to prevent crashes or exploits.

## CIA Triad Comparison Table

| Feature | Primary Goal | Compromised By... | Real-World Solution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Confidentiality** | Keep secrets. | Phishing, MitM attacks. | **MFA & Encryption** |
| **Integrity** | Keep data accurate. | SQL Injection, Malware. | **Hashing & Digital Signatures** |
| **Availability** | Keep systems up. | DDoS, Hardware failure. | **Redundancy & Backups** |

## CIA vs. AAA (Exam Comparison)

A common SY0-701 exam trap is confusing the **Security Goals (CIA)** with the **Enforcement Framework (AAA)**.

* **CIA** = What we are trying to achieve (The **Goals**).
* **AAA** (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) = How we control the users who interact with the data (The **Process**).

> **Exam Tip:** If a question describes a scenario where a user changes their grade in a database, the pillar that has been violated is **Integrity**. If a hacker steals a list of passwords, it is **Confidentiality**.
