## 1. Deception Technology Categories

Think of these as a hierarchy of "traps," ranging from a single fake record to an entire fake data center.

| **Tool** | **Scope** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Honeypot** | Single System | A decoy server or device (e.g., a fake web server) designed to be probed and attacked. |
| **Honeynet** | Entire Network | A collection of multiple honeypots that simulate a network (fake routers, firewalls, and servers). |
| **Honeyfile** | Single File | A fake file (e.g., `passwords.xlsx`) placed on a real server to act as a "tripwire" when opened. |
| **Honeytoken** | Data Element | Traceable "fake" data (e.g., a fake email address or API key) used to track data exfiltration. |

## 2. Honeypots and Honeynets

The primary goal of a **Honeypot** is to observe the "Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures" (**TTPs**) of an attacker.

* **Low-interaction Honeypot:** Simulates only basic services (like a fake SSH login). It's easy to set up but won't fool a sophisticated hacker for long.
* **High-interaction Honeypot:** A real operating system with real vulnerabilities. It's more convincing but carries a higher risk because the attacker could potentially use it to jump into your real network if not properly isolated.
* **Honeynet:** By connecting multiple honeypots, you create a "virtual world." This allows you to see how an attacker moves **laterally** (east-to-west) from one server to another.

## 3. Honeyfiles and Honeytokens: The Digital "Bait"

These are used within your *real* production environment to detect breaches early.

### Honeyfiles

You might place a file named `Executive_Salaries.pdf` in a folder. No legitimate employee has a reason to open it.

* **The Trap:** If a "File Open" event is logged for this file, you have a **100% certain** indicator that either an insider is snooping or an external attacker has compromised an account.

### Honeytokens (The "Canary" in the Coal Mine)

A honeytoken is data that doesn't actually work but is unique and traceable.

* **Example 1 (Fake Email):** You put a fake email address in your database. If that address suddenly starts receiving spam, you know your database was stolen and sold to spammers.
* **Example 2 (Fake API Key):** You leave a fake AWS API key in a script. If someone tries to use that key to log in, your security system alerts you immediately.

## 4. Key Benefits for the Exam

When answering questions about deception, look for these key "selling points":

1. **Low False Positives:** Since no legitimate user should ever touch a honeypot or honeyfile, any activity is almost certainly malicious.
2. **Evidence Collection:** They provide high-quality logs of exactly what the attacker tried to do.
3. **Wasting Attacker Time:** Deception forces the attacker to spend hours trying to "hack" systems that don't actually exist, giving your team time to respond.
