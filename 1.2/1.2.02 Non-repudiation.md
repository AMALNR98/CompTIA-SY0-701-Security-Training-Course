## 1. Non-Repudiation: The Concept

Non-repudiation is achieved when you have two things: **Proof of Origin** (who did it) and **Proof of Integrity** (that it hasn't changed).

* **Definition:** The assurance that the sender of information is provided with proof of delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of the sender's identity, so neither can later deny having processed the data.
* **Key Component:** **Digital Signatures** are the primary technical tool used to enforce non-repudiation.

## 2. Proof of Integrity: The "Encyclopedia" Analogy

Integrity ensures data hasn't been tampered with. CompTIA often uses the concept of **Hashing** to explain this.

### The Encyclopedia Analogy

Imagine you have a 30-volume set of an encyclopedia. You want to make sure no one changes a single letter in any volume over the next 10 years.

1. You run a **hashing algorithm** (like SHA-256) over the entire text of the encyclopedia.
2. This produces a "fingerprint" or **Message Digest** (a short string of text like `ef7a92...`).
3. **The Test:** If someone changes just one comma in Volume 14, the entire hash will change completely (this is called the **Avalanche Effect**).
4. By comparing the current hash to your original stored hash, you have **Proof of Integrity**.

## 3. Proof of Origin: Digital Signatures

While a hash proves a file hasn't changed, it doesn't prove *who* sent it. For that, we need **Asymmetric Encryption** (Public/Private keys).

### Creating a Digital Signature (The Sender's Side)

To sign a document, the sender (Alice) follows these steps:

1. **Hash the Message:** Create a message digest of the data.
2. **Encrypt the Hash:** Alice encrypts that digest using **her own Private Key**.
3. **Result:** The encrypted hash is the **Digital Signature**. It is attached to the original message and sent.

### Verifying a Digital Signature (The Receiver's Side)

When Bob receives the message, he verifies it to ensure **Proof of Origin**:

1. **Decrypt the Signature:** Bob uses **Alice's Public Key** to decrypt the signature. This reveals the original hash Alice created.
2. **Re-hash the Message:** Bob runs the same hashing algorithm on the message he received.
3. **The Comparison:** Bob compares his fresh hash with the one he decrypted.
* **If they match:** He knows the message wasn't changed (Integrity) and only Alice could have sent it (Origin), because only her Private Key could have created that signature.

## Summary Table for the Exam

| Goal | Mechanism | Key Used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Integrity Only** | Hashing (MD5, SHA) | No key required |
| **Confidentiality** | Encryption (AES, RSA) | Recipient's Public Key |
| **Digital Signature (Sign)** | Hashing + Encryption | **Sender's Private Key** |
| **Digital Signature (Verify)** | Decryption + Comparison | **Sender's Public Key** |

> **Exam Tip:** Remember the "Private Key" rule. You **sign** with your **private** key (something only you have) so that others can **verify** with your **public** key (something everyone has).
