## 1. Change Management Roles and Ownership

A successful change requires clear accountability.

* **Owner:** The person or department requesting the change (e.g., a DB Admin who needs to upgrade a database).
* **Stakeholders:** Individuals or groups affected by the change (e.g., users who will lose access during the upgrade).
* **Change Advisory Board (CAB):** A group of experts and managers who review high-risk changes and provide approval or denial.

## 2. The Change Approval Process

The exam often asks about the specific sequence of events in a formal change.

1. **Request for Change (RFC):** Documenting the "Why," "What," and "When."
2. **Impact Analysis:** Assessing the risk. What happens if this fails? Who will be affected?
3. **Testing:** The change must be tested in a non-production (sandbox) environment first.
4. **Approval:** Management or the CAB signs off on the change based on test results.
5. **Implementation:** The change is made during the **Maintenance Window**.
6. **Review/Documentation:** Confirming the change worked and updating the network maps/documentation.

## 3. Key Components of a Change Plan

| **Component** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Impact Analysis** | A deep dive into the risks. It identifies dependencies (e.g., "If we patch the Web Server, will the API still talk to it?"). |
| **Test Results** | Evidence that the change worked in a lab. You **never** implement a major change without documented successful tests. |
| **Backout Plan** | A "Plan B" or rollback strategy. If the change fails during implementation, this is the step-by-step guide to revert to the original state. |
| **Maintenance Window** | A pre-scheduled, low-impact timeframe (e.g., Sunday at 2:00 AM) when changes are allowed to happen. |

## 4. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

An **SOP** is a set of step-by-step instructions compiled by an organization to help workers carry out complex routine operations.

* **In Change Management:** For "Standard" or "Routine" changes (like a monthly OS patch), an SOP allows the change to be pre-approved so it doesn't have to go through the CAB every single time.
* **Security Value:** SOPs ensure consistency. If every admin follows the same SOP, there is less chance of a "human error" configuration that leaves a port open.

## 5. Comparison: Standard vs. Emergency Changes

| **Change Type** | **Approval Needed?** | **Characteristics** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Standard** | Pre-approved | Low risk, routine, follows an established SOP. |
| **Normal** | Full CAB Review | Significant impact, requires testing and formal sign-off. |
| **Emergency** | Immediate / Post-facto | Used to fix a critical security breach or total system outage. |

> **Exam Tip:** If a question asks "What is the most important document to have before implementing a high-risk patch?" look for the **Backout Plan**. If it asks "Who decides if a change is too risky for the company?" the answer is the **CAB**.
